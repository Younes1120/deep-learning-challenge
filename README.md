# Deep Learning Challenge: Predicting Charity Funding for Alphabet Soup

## Overview
The objective of this deep learning challenge is to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit foundation that supports various organizations. We will utilize machine learning and neural networks to build a model that can effectively select the most promising funding applicants.

## Step 1: Preprocess the Data
In this step, we will prepare the dataset for training our neural network model.

- **Target Variable**: The target variable for our model is "IS_SUCCESSFUL," which indicates whether an applicant was successfully funded (1) or not (0).
- **Features**: The features for our model include various metadata about each organization, such as APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, and ASK_AMT.

We will drop the EIN and NAME columns as they are identification columns and not relevant for the model.

We will identify the number of unique values for each column and, for columns with more than 10 unique values, we will determine the number of data points for each unique value. Based on this, we will bin "rare" categorical variables together as 'Other'.

Using pd.get_dummies(), we will encode the categorical variables into numerical values. The preprocessed data will be split into features (X) and the target (y) arrays, and further divided into training and testing datasets. To ensure consistency in the data, we will scale the features using the StandardScaler.

## Step 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
Now, we will design and train the neural network model for binary classification.

- **Model Architecture**: We will create a neural network with appropriate input features and nodes for each layer using TensorFlow and Keras.
- **Hidden Layers**: We will add hidden layers with appropriate activation functions to learn the patterns in the data.
- **Output Layer**: The output layer will have an activation function suitable for binary classification.

We will compile the model and train it on the training dataset. To monitor the model's progress during training, we will create a callback to save the model's weights every five epochs. Finally, we will evaluate the model using the test data to calculate the loss and accuracy.

The results will be saved and exported to an HDF5 file named "AlphabetSoupCharity.h5".

## Step 3: Optimize the Model 
In this step, we will optimize the model to achieve a predictive accuracy higher than 75%.

Possible optimization methods include:

- Adjusting input data to handle outliers or confusion-causing variables.
- Adding more neurons and hidden layers to the model.
- Trying different activation functions for the hidden layers.
- Modifying the number of epochs during training.

We will create a new Google Colab file named "AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb" and perform preprocessing and model optimization steps.

The optimized results will be saved and exported to an HDF5 file named "AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5".

## Step 4: Report on the Neural Network Model
In this step, we will write a report on the performance of the deep learning model for Alphabet Soup.

The report will cover:

- Data Preprocessing: Explanation of the target and feature variables, variables to remove, and the results of preprocessing steps.
- Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model: Details about the neural network model, its architecture, and the achieved performance.
- Optimization Summary: A summary of the optimization attempts and whether the target performance was reached.
- Recommendation: A recommendation for a different model that may improve classification results.

## Step 5: Repository Organization
After completing the analysis in Google Colab, we will ensure the following steps are performed for the final submission:

- Download the Colab notebooks to the local computer.
- Move the notebooks into the "deep-learning-challenge" directory in the local repository.
- Push the added files to GitHub.

This repository will contain all the necessary files, including the Jupyter notebooks, the data file "charity_data.csv," and the report in Markdown format.

**Note:** Since the instructions mention using Google Colab, it is advised to set up a new Google Colab notebook for each step (Step 1, Step 2, and Optimization). The optimized results can then be saved as "AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5" and the report can be written in Markdown format. Each step's notebook and the report can be stored in the "deep-learning-challenge" directory within the local repository.
